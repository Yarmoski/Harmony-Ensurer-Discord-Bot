# Harmony-Ensurer-Discord-Bot

This is a bot that I made for my friend's Discord server using Python and discord.py. (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

It is based on a joke concept that the socialist party is watching every message and censors "banned words."

I left comments within the code to explain what is going on. Mainly the core functionality is present, there are no commands or extras in this version of the bot.

The bot is easily customizable to fit any censorship or even moderation needs. :)

Since I had lots of problems with learning discord.py and deciphering tutorials made on older versions, this took much longer than expected :p
But I'm happy with how it turned out :D
